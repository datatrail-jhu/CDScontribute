# How to Contribute to the Chromebook Data Science project

## Content Development
### Where to find the content?
The most important way to contribute to the project at this point is content development. You can contribute by developing course lessons by choosing a lesson from the Trello board and pushing your files to the corresponding course repository. Since others have already started contributing to course development, make sure no other person has already claimed a course on Trello.

## Where to find the Github repos

## How to start

Shannon has provided a nice checklist for what is expected from your contribution [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pznQ1OG3sn2seCeaBRL6ig4tFeBQjKw7Ws_ndvraRU/edit). In sum, you need to provide a `.md` file of the lesson content, a `.md` file for the course script for Ari, a Google Slide presentation, and a folder with all the images used in the slides and the lesson content.

### Markua Style

It is important that you avoid complicated language and write an easy-to-read lesson. The intent of this program is to educate individuals with little to no knowledge of computers and data science. The content is written in Markup languge called Markua. For a guide on how to write your lesson in Markua, check this [link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#leanpub-auto-what-is-markua).

### Creating images

You can make a pdf file of your slides and convert pdf to pngs by using pdf2png.com or through imagemagik.

### File naming

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ElVzRC4f8Z7pFH4dh4EmH-wb4GCQk1NzLSiItF1DlQ/edit#slide=id.p) is also a one-sheet guide for file naming conventions. 

### Slides

Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/143gvqcynq_bl7iVd2G9yjumwJJkAy0S6CyNCsrJ2LgE/edit#slide=id.p) for creating your slides.

### Quizzes and exercises

Make sure to add a quiz at the end of each lesson! Quizzes have two main purposes. a) to test learner's knowledge b) prevent learners from completing a course lesson without reading and understanding the content.


### Sample course

You can also check our our first course that is complete [here](https://github.com/jhudsl/cds_intro) (private repo). It will help you get an idea of writing style and how to create the slides and the script files.

### Ari dictionary

You don't have to worry about this. Ari has issues reading names like package names so we're creating a dictionary that spells out the name for Ari for better pronounciation. You can add your words [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlZNiSV7CQhRLZj1-_EFTNEnErMjcpkVP_2NH6y73iQ/edit#gid=0)

### Sample logins

A list of the accounts we created for Google and Github can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cr0cwPR03ois5IOHzFHW044e_EGHlWRfTfQlOj_-rEs/edit?usp=sharing).


## Authorship Right
While you will be acknowledged in the course content, by contributing to this project you agree to transfer the ownership of the content to develop to Chromebook Data Science Project and Jeffrey T. Leek. Althogh our intent is to redirect revenues back to the project, there is some revenue generated from the project (mainly through Leanpub). The transfer of authorship rights is to avoid the complexitiy that arises with the revenue generate from the project.

## What else

Keep the following items in mind for an easy-to-read lesson.

1. Avoid technical language!
2. Explain new concepts! If you refer to a technical term (e.g. `dplyr`, `baseR`, or `Data Viz`) be sure that those terms are clearly defined in previous courses or course items.
3. Do not introduce concepts, tools, or packages outside of the curriculum! If you have a suggesition for a course item, add it to the Trello board.
4. Use explanatory charts and graphs! And avoid using irrelevant graphics.
5. Use examples! Examples are a great way to learn.
6. Be aware of plagiarism and copyrighted content! Do not use any copyrighted third-party content and any content under Creative Content has to be commercial purposes as well. 
7. [Freepik.com](www.freepik.com) is a great place to find CC-BY images that are ok to use for commercial use (however, not all images are allowed for commercial use.)
8. Cite! You are responsible to cite the sources that you use in your content. If it is an image, provide the link where you downloaded the image at the bottom. If you cite a blog post, journal article, video, or any other document, provide the link and the date you accessed the content.
