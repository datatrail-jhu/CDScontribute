# How to Contribute to the Chromebook Data Science project

## Content Development
### Where to find the content?
The most important way to contribute to the project at this point is content development. You can contribute by developing course lessons by choosing a lesson from the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/6HPYp8jO/chromebook-data-science) and pushing your files to the corresponding course repository. Since others have already started contributing to course development, make sure no other person has already claimed a course on Trello.

## Where to find the Github repos

## How to start

Shannon has provided a nice checklist for what is expected from your contribution [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pznQ1OG3sn2seCeaBRL6ig4tFeBQjKw7Ws_ndvraRU/edit) - (updated 2018-05-11). In sum, you need to provide:
* a `.md` file of the lesson content
* a `.md` file for the course script for Ari 
* a Google Slide presentation 

Note: (You no longer have to download the slides to PDF and PNGs)

### Markua Style

It is important that you avoid complicated language and write an easy-to-read lesson. The intent of this program is to educate individuals with little to no knowledge of computers and data science. The content is written in Markup languge called Markua. For a guide on how to write your lesson in Markua, check this [link](https://leanpub.com/markua/read#leanpub-auto-what-is-markua).

UPDATE (2018-05-11) : For using regular expressions and displaying only a subset wrong answers, see information from email [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eW1K6JE6h-qeDmSy_ODtMsJr-4UojlXsvHQs75lDj-I/edit?usp=sharing).

### Creating images

All images should be included in your Google Slides Presentation. These images should be referenced in your manuscript file using the following convention (images/00_lecturename/00_coursename_lecturename-0.png). 

**Note**: These images are **0-based**, so the png referenced above would be your title slide. You do not have to download the PDF or individual PNGs. 

### File naming

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ElVzRC4f8Z7pFH4dh4EmH-wb4GCQk1NzLSiItF1DlQ/edit#slide=id.p) is also a one-sheet guide for file naming conventions. (Updated: 2018-05-11)

### Slides

Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/143gvqcynq_bl7iVd2G9yjumwJJkAy0S6CyNCsrJ2LgE/edit#slide=id.p) for creating your slides.

### Scripts

You'll want one paragraph per slide in your Google Slides presentation. You'll want to remove all markdown syntax and URLs that you don't want read out loud from this file. Ensure that the number of paragraphs in your _script.md file is equal to the number of slides in your Google Slides presentation.

### Quizzes and exercises

Make sure to add a quiz at the end of each lesson! Quizzes have two main purposes. a) to test learner's knowledge b) prevent learners from completing a course lesson without reading and understanding the content.

UPDATE (2018-05-11) : For using regular expressions and displaying only a subset wrong answers, see information from email [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eW1K6JE6h-qeDmSy_ODtMsJr-4UojlXsvHQs75lDj-I/edit?usp=sharing).

### Sample course

You can also check our our first course that is complete [here](https://github.com/jhudsl/cds_intro) (private repo). It will help you get an idea of writing style and how to create the slides and the script files.

### Ari dictionary

You don't have to worry about this. Ari has issues reading names like package names so we're creating a dictionary that spells out the name for Ari for better pronunciation. You can add your words [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RlZNiSV7CQhRLZj1-_EFTNEnErMjcpkVP_2NH6y73iQ/edit#gid=0)

### Sample logins

A list of the accounts we created for Google and Github can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cr0cwPR03ois5IOHzFHW044e_EGHlWRfTfQlOj_-rEs/edit?usp=sharing).

## What else

Keep the following items in mind for an easy-to-read lesson.

1. Avoid technical language!
2. Explain new concepts! If you refer to a technical term (e.g. `dplyr`, `baseR`, or `Data Viz`) be sure that those terms are clearly defined in previous courses or course items.
3. Do not introduce concepts, tools, or packages outside of the curriculum! If you have a suggestion for a course item, add it to the Trello board.
4. Use explanatory charts and graphs! And avoid using irrelevant graphics.
5. Use examples! Examples are a great way to learn.
6. Be aware of plagiarism and copyrighted content! Do not use any copyrighted third-party content and any content under Creative Content has to be commercial purposes as well.
7. [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/) is a great place to find CC-BY images that are ok to use for commercial use (however, not all images are allowed for commercial use.) Also check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for beautiful free photos.
8. Cite! You are responsible to cite the sources that you use in your content. If it is an image, provide the link where you downloaded the image at the bottom. If you cite a blog post, journal article, video, or any other document, provide the link and the date you accessed the content.
